This is a python code that creates an excel file containing data it receives via serial communication
and uploads that data to Sondehub.


Things to note:
change rockoon data here, as well as data you want to appear in excel and sondehub
MAKE SURE TO change the paths for excel creation, as the current ones only work on my PC.
