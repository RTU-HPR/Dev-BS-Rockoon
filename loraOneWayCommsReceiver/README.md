This is a code containing LoRa communications code, for the receiver end of things
it is currently unfinished - should move LoRa functions to a different file contained /include, and overall clean the code up
Additional things to be added/defined - all the LoRa variables, and encryption, and also different error messages

something to read later, might be a useful rehash
