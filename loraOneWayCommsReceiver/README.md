This is a code for a one way LoRa receiver. 
At it's current stage it does the following:
    Receives LoRa communications on the default frequency (434), bandwith, etc
    Prints received packets into serial.
What to know before running it:
    Pins are set for a Heltec WiFi LoRa v3, change if running on anything else.
To-do:
    Add comments;
    move LoRa function to a header file, or whatever the things in /include are called;


something to read later, might be a useful rehash
